Tools for [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh).

# Requirements

- A desktop platform with the [.NET Core SDK 2.2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started) or higher installed.
- When working with the codebase, we recommend using an IDE with intellisense and syntax highlighting, such as [Visual Studio 2017+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- These instructions assume you have the the [CLI git client](https://git-scm.com/) installed, but any other GUI client such as GitKraken will suffice.
- Note that there are **[additional requirements for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/windows-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x)** which you may need to manually install if your operating system is not up-to-date.

# Getting Started

- Clone the repository including submodules (`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/aticie/osu-tools`)

    - [PerformanceCalculator](https://github.com/ppy/osu-tools/blob/master/PerformanceCalculator/README.md) - A tool for calculating the difficulty of beatmaps and the performance of replays.
